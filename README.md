# Multiverse Dashboard

This is a stripped down version of Dominik Veselý's [Multiverse Tools](https://github.com/d-vesely/multiverse-tools), retaining only the dashboard functionality and its required files. It has been modified to read preset files from disk instead of user uploads. It has also been adapted for inclusion in PHAIDRA's [mūsēum ](https://github.com/phaidra/museum).

## Build instructions

Run ./build.sh to build the Docker image.
